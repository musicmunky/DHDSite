There\u2019s me Ray, then there\u2019s Will and Raf. Two of us are related, but Will is taller than Raf who spent five dollars more than me on ice-cream. You do the math. If you see us at a party, we're the three dudes in the back arguing about whether or not a light saber could stop an oncoming Mario fireball (in case you were wondering, oh yeah, it can), or if the lung capacity of a cheetah is greater than that of a house cat (we really have no idea).\r\n\r\nThe site itself is maintained by, I think it was...yup...I'm sure of it: magic. Most of our brainstorming sessions involve Will dangling Raf off of the balcony yelling, \"THIS TIME I'M REALLY GONNA DO IT!\". He half did it once. As you can tell the site is fairly minimalistic. This is, sadly, because only Raf can draw, and he refuses to until his petition for February's right to have the same number of days as other months becomes law. Thanks for the show of solidarity, Raf.\r\n\r\nThe name was Will's idea, so you can blame him for it. Unless you like it, in which case send me an email saying so, and I'll rub it in his face.\r\n\r\n<strong>[<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rafaan\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">RAF<\/span><\/a><\/span> ENTERS STAGE RIGHT]<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHello. This is Raf. I'd like to be frank for a moment if I may. Okay, I'm done. I'd like to be Raf again. I'll begin at the beginning. \u00a0The idea of starting a web comic came to us during dinner.\u00a0 We wanted to venture into something new and exciting, so we deliberated and narrowed it down to two viable options: option A was starting a web-comic; option B was becoming superheros. \u00a0When it was made clear to us that the ability to consume large quantities of food in a short period of time was NOT a superpower, we went with option A.\r\n\r\nBy now you're probably asking yourself, \"Is this guy just distracting me so he can steal my sandwich?\" \u00a0Well sir\/madam, it seems your audacity knows no bounds! \u00a0You can have your sandwich back, I don't even want it anymore.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the comic is simply a commentary on life, love and sandwiches.\r\n\r\n<strong>[<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/willsamari\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">WILL<\/span><\/a><\/span> IS FOUND AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM EATING ALL THE NACHOS]<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI'd first like to clear up something that my colleagues have falsely lead you to believe. \u00a0I never have, nor will I ever, like\u00a0pants.\r\n\r\nI should also warn you that Ray and Raf are feeding you a bunch of bologna (Luuucky) about why we decided to start our website. \u00a0The truth is we know that web-comics are where all the money and fame is at and we want a piece. \u00a0It was obvious that in order to be successful in this biz, you need to be good with humor, drawing, math and computers. \u00a0Well we kick some serious butt at drawing and math so we figured 2 out of 3 wasn't bad.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the comic is simply a commentary on the love life of sandwiches.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"About Us","post_status":"publish","post_name":"about-us","post_modified":"2014-03-03 15:07:14","post_modified_gmt":"2014-03-03 20:07:14","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.thedoghousediaries.com\/?page_id=54","post_type":"page","post_live_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","post_meta":{"comic_description":"","comic_file":"","comic_large":"","comic_medium":"","comic_small":""}},"56":{"post_id":"56","post_author":"5","post_date":"2009-01-15 13:31:18","post_date_gmt":"2009-01-15 18:31:18","post_content":"Q: Why are your comics so funny?\r\nA: Glad you asked, Mom.\r\n\r\nQ: My girlfriend is really upset with me, can you guys give me girl advice?\r\nA: Which one of our comics lead you to believe we were a good choice for this question?\r\n\r\nQ: Boxers or briefs?\r\nA: You know I really don't think that's any of your man-thongs.\r\nQ: What?\r\nA: What?\r\n\r\nQ: Are any of your comics from personal experiences?\r\nA: Raf once ate a 50 ft donut, Will talked to a girl about his feelings once, and Ray is actually the Monopoly Guy.\r\n\r\nQ: Which one of you is the best looking?\r\nA: That ones easy. Definita af aF^Wfal@jw(\r\n\r\nQ:\u00a0Why did you guys decide to start a web comic?\r\nA: We actually\u00a0started as a dating advice service. \u00a0People laughed at our advice :(\r\n\r\nQ: If you were stranded on a desert island...\r\nA: Stop right there.

But we've just been to Phoenix ... and South Dakota.\r\n\r\nQ: Are any of the questions on your FAQ board real?\r\nA: Yup.\r\nQ: So is that question going to be the only real one you post?\r\nA: Nope.\r\n\r\nQ: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\r\nA: Too many variables here. The age, sex, chucking speed, and mental health of the woodchuck must all be factored in. There's also the species of tree, time of day, the reason for which the woodchuck is chucking, if there's a female woodchuck watching (you'd be surprised), if the measurements are taken in Florida or Ohio, and probably most obviously, where the woodchuck sees himself in five years.\r\n\r\nQ: Does this make me look fat?\r\nA: No. Wow, you stretched that out pretty good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr

Not all of these are necessarily the most common nicknames, nor are they all nicknames that the city chose for itself. Many of them were chosen simply because I thought they were the most interesting\/entertaining. Within this context, I'll point out that City of Hate is not at all a common nickname for Dallas.  Big-D would be the more common, and more accurate one. I've been there. Lovely people. 2. Where I placed cities on the population fame influence scale was an incredibly unscientific process. 3. Having a cool or not cool nickname doesn't make the city itself more or less great. This was purely for entertainment purposes and I hope it doesn't offend anyone.\r\n<br>\r\n<center>\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pebble\">@Pebble<\/a> team did an incredible job because I feel like I absolutely need one of their new watches...

A few months ago we started talking about finding a way to get the band back together because it just stunk not doing this anymore. The ideas never stopped, it was just hard to find time to sit down and draw comics.\r\n\r\nNow this may come as a shock to literally everyone, but we're not the greatest at drawing. We're actually not even very good at it. We are, in fact, the worst. It was one of the things holding us back from getting started again. Drawing the comics sometimes took hours for the simplest little sketch that should really only take 20 minutes for someone who's a semi-competent illustrator. That's why we decided to just get started again in the simplest form there is: written content. And we were actually surprised how much we enjoyed what we were making once we tried it. \r\nWe'll be sharing some of the stuff we've been working on shortly. Until then, we'll be whipping up a few standard style comics for you. We do plan to eventually expand to other mediums for our content again including comic form, but for now we're kind of excited about the potential for this medium.\r\n\r\nWe're happy to be back and thanks for sticking with us :)","post_title":"We're Back","post_status":"publish","post_name":"we-re-back","post_modified":"2017-05-01 14:32:13","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-01 18:32:13","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/thedoghousediaries.com\/?p=6025","post_type":"post","post_live_date":"2017-05-01 14:44:02","post_meta":{"comic_description":"And we're not leaving this time.
